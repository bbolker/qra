Description: Functions are provided that implement the 
    use of the Fieller's formula methodology, for 
    calculating a confidence interval for a ratio of
    (very likely, correlated) means.  See Fieller (1954)
    <doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1954.tb00159.x>.
    The application of primary interest is the calculation 
    of confidence intervals for the dose that results in 
    a specified mortality proportion among those exposed,
    commonly 0.50, or 0.90, or 0.99.  A vignette demonstrates
    link functions that may be considered, and alternative 
    choices of error family.  Note in particular the
    beta-binomial error family.  See also Maindonald, Waddell, 
    and Petry (2001) <doi:10.1016/S0925-5214(01)00082-5>.
