This git repository holds the source files for the qra package for R.
At this point (10 May 2018), it is not on CRAN.  The package has utility
functions and data for use for quantal response analysis, with the
analysis of insect mortality data from exposure-mortality experiments
primarily in mind.  "Exposure" may be dose of a fumigant, time in cold
storage, or another such measure.

This development version can be installed using the
`install_git()` function from the `devtools` package, thus:
```
devtools::install_git('https://gitlab.com/daagur/qra.git')
```

Use the available options for `install.packages()` as required, e.g.,
to ensure that vignettes are built (by default, they are not:)
```
devtools::install_git('https://gitlab.com/daagur/qra.git',build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

One may want to specify `upgrade_dependencies = FALSE`, and attend separately
to the updating of dependencies, and/or to specify, e.g.
`dependencies=c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")`. (By default,
`dependencies=TRUE`., i.e., also "Suggests".)
