This git repository holds the source files for the qra package for R.
At this point (10 May 2018), it is not on CRAN.  The package has utility
functions and data for use for quantal response analysis, with the
analysis of insect mortality data from exposure-mortality experiments
primarily in mind.  "Exposure" may be dose of a fumigant, time in cold
storage, or another such measure.
