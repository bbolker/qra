This repository holds the source files for the qra package for R.
The package has utility functions and data for use for quantal response 
analysis, with the analysis of insect mortality data from exposure-mortality 
experiments primarily in mind.  "Exposure" may be dose of a fumigant, time 
in cold storage, or another such measure.

This development version can be installed using the
`install_github()` function from the `devtools` package, thus:
```
devtools::install_github(jhmaindonald/qra}}
```

Use the available options for `install.packages()` as required, e.g.,
to ensure that vignettes are built (by default, they are not:)
```
devtools::install_github(jhmaindonald/qra, build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

One may want to specify `upgrade_dependencies = FALSE`, and attend separately
to the updating of dependencies, and/or to specify, e.g.
`dependencies=c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")`. (By default,
`dependencies=TRUE`., i.e., also "Suggests".)
